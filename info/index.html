    <p>This website was created because the original website of Alexander Blade got shut down and there is no
        alternative as of now.
        <br>
        As you can see the theme differs a lot since the original theme wasn't too good in our thoughts. The way how it
        works, however, is pretty much the same!</p>

    <h4>How to edit native information?</h4>
    <p>You also may noticed that there is no edit function at the moment. This is because we simple didn't implement it
        yet because we want some kind of review system so no one can destroy anything!
        If you still really want to edit some information of a native please visit <a class="externlink"
                                                                                      href="https://github.com/DatBrick/NativeDatabase/">this</a>
        repository. In order to edit something you first need to fork the repo
        and make the changes you'd like to do. After that is done you simply create a pull request and we'll review it.
        Once we review and merged your changes the website updates automatically.</p>
