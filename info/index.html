    <p>This website was created because the original website of Alexander Blade got shut down and there is no
        alternative as of now.
        <br>
        As you can see the theme differs a bit, since the original theme was too hard to read late at night, although it
        works pretty much the same!</p>

    <h4>How to edit native information?</h4>
    <p>You also may noticed that there is no edit function at the moment. This is because it simply isn't implemented
        yet, in any case some kind of review system might be a better idea so the database doent get destroyed like the original!
        If you still really want to edit some information of a native please visit <a class="externlink"
                                                                                      href="https://github.com/Give-Two/give-two.github.io">this</a>
        repository. In order to edit something you will first need to fork the repo
        and make the changes you'd like, then simply create a pull request for review.
        Once reviewed it can be merged into the main repository.</p>
